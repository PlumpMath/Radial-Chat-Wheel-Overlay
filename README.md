# Radial Chat Wheel Overlay
A simple overlay chat wheel that can be used anywhere

This overlay was made a temporal fix to the lack of a quick-chat function in Heroes of The Storm. 
While the in-game pinging function gets a lot of stuff done, sometimes you need something more than a blunt "retreat". 

## What exactly does it do?

It works just as you would expect a radial chat wheel to work.
You hold a hotkey, move your mouse over the needed phrase and let go of the hotkey. 
Then the phrase gets sent to your chat. As simple as that. 

There is a simple configuration utility built-in.
